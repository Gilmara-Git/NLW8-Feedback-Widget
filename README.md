## About

This application allows users to send feedbacks about your app or website.
It has been styled to be located to the bottom right corner of the page.
There are 3 types of feedbacks to choose, an **issue**, an **idea** or **other**.
Users can also take a screenshot and send along with their feedback.
Upon sending a feedback, an email is sent to the user with their **comment** and the **screenshot** taken. (Optional)
